## Aimbot Improvement

### Line of Sight Check

In order to improve the aimbot functionality, we have implemented a line of sight check. The aimbot will now only activate when the target is visible, ensuring that it does not lock onto targets that are hidden behind walls or other obstacles. This feature is designed to enhance gameplay by making it more fair and balanced.

### Team Check Functionality

The team check functionality has also been reviewed and updated to ensure that it works properly. Players will only be targeted if they are on the opposite team, preventing any targeting of teammates. This ensures team integrity during gameplay.

### Implementation Details
- The line of sight check algorithm has been optimized for performance.
- Additional debugging information will be logged to monitor the functionality.

### Conclusion
The improvements made to the aimbot ensure a more competitive environment, allowing players to engage each other based on skill rather than unfair advantages.
